I'm a junior at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/" class="underline">Princeton University</a>, concentrating in Electrical and Computer Engineering and pursuing minors in Chinese Language and Computer Science. 

I enjoy working on both hardware and software (and at their intersection) on topics like wireless communications, computer networking, distributed computing paradigms, kernel bypassing modules like eBPF, semiconductors and solid-state devices, and various hardware projects. 

Outside academics, I love creating with my hands: anything from traditional Ukrainian beaded jewelry and crocheting to VGA graphics card built on digital logic chips (see my projects page for more!). In the summer, I enjoy hiking and long-distance running. 

Iâ€™m originally from a small village in Western Ukraine, and my roots inspire my drive to learn, create, and make an impact.
